# Workflow Query App

A Next.js app for finding which team owns a block in an Ivanti workflow. Queries the latest version of all `*form` workflows in SQL Server and returns matching blocks with their team assignments.

## What it does

Searches across workflow definitions and returns matching blocks with their team assignments. Results can be exported to CSV directly from the results table.

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| Workflow Name | Name of the workflow |
| Version | Latest definition version |
| Offering Status | Associated request offering status (Published, Design, No Offering) |
| Block Title | Title of the matching block |
| Block Type | `task`, `advancedtask`, or `update` |
| Team Name | Team assigned to the block |

Filters are optional — leaving any field blank searches across all values. When results are returned, an **Export CSV** button appears in the results header to download the current rows as a `.csv` file.

## Setup

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root:

```
DB_SERVER=your-sql-server
DB_DATABASE=your-database
DB_USER=your-username
DB_PASSWORD=your-password
DB_PORT=1433
```

Install dependencies and run the dev server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
